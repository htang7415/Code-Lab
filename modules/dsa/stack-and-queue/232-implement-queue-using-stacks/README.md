# 232.Implement Queue using Stacks

> Track: `dsa` | Topic: `stack-and-queue`

## Concept

Use two stacks: push to in-stack, pop/peek from out-stack after transferring.

## Function

```python
class MyQueue:
    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
    def pop(self) -> int:
    def peek(self) -> int:
    def empty(self) -> bool:
```
